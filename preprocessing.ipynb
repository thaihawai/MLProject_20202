We’re chucking out crusty old cash registers and replacing them with i Pads, touch screens and beautiful software, all of this to make life easier for our retailers.  Vend is a fast-growing tech start-up, since launching in 2010 we’ve now got 10,000+ customers all over the world and have more than 100 employees. In case you’re interested in our tech stack we use Capistrano, Redis, Git / Github, Vagrant, Jenkins, Puppet, Resque, New Relic, Doctrine, My SQL, Objective C, PHP, Java Script, GO, Symfony, Rake, Selenium, Compass, SASS, j Query, Bundler, Nginx, and a bunch of other things.Why you’d like us: Our engineering department houses some of the smartest minds in NZ, they work tirelessly with our product teams to come up with the best and brightest new features and fixes for the Vend platform. As you can see from our tech stack above, we use the latest and greatest to bring delight to our customers, and want to add members to our team that live and breathe technology just like we do.As well as developing a world-leading product, we believe that our culture is world-leading too! We balance super hard work with having a lot of fun at work!  Like playing pool, getting a Dia de los Muertos makeover, zoning out on the couches listening to music or raiding the snack cupboard (FYI frozen marshmallows are the latest craze at Vend - seriously, try them!). Work-life balance.  We know you have a life outside of work. We know you probably have little side projects or businesses too. This is valued and at Vend you can have a life inside work to. We’ll also give you a $5,000 allowance per year to develop your skills and attend conferences of your choice. Within reason, of course. We turned down the guy who wanted to use the five large to go to a heavy metal concert on a cruise ship.    \n\n       fraudulent  \n40              0  \n48              0  \n56              0  \n62              0  \n80              0  \n...           ...  \n17847           0  \n17853           0  \n17854           0  \n17874           0  \n17879           0  \n\n[3132 rows x 3 columns]"
